# Size Invariant Ship Detection from SAR Images

### Overview

- Ship detection from remote sensing imagery is a crucial application for maritime security. When talking about maritime security, we have to consider many things like traffic surveillance, protection against illegal fisheries, oil discharge control, sea pollution monitoring, etc.
- Automated Identification System (AIS) are very effective at monitoring ships which are legally required to install a VHF transponder, but fail to detect those which are not, and those which disconnect their transponder.
- So how do you detect these uncooperative ships? The solution is using: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)

## A Deep Learning based approach to detect ships from satellite images. 

Implementation of this repository has been kept confidential for the time being due to confidentiality agreement but these are some of the outputs from the Experimentaion :
